We have produced a total of 6296 pull requests on github -- that's change proposals to code and documentation.

Also you know what is more amazing than writing a brand new super-useful, super important piece of code? Deleting it! ahh, Joys of Deleting.

That has produced 4469 releases of our applications MAYBE MENTION AN APPLICATION

By the looks of it, we're deploying most of the time. The last year, we have logged 26 284 deploys, 12 721 to our happy test servers who live on the bleeding edge all the time, 9 459 times to our more stable QA environment and 4 104 to our lovely production servers. In order to get all of that work done, our deploy script has been running for more than 3 513 887 seconds, or just a little bit less than 6 weeks.

It's a very diligent script!

What do our users do?

This would really take way too much investigation to answer thoroughly, but one thing we know they really like doing is to track shipments! We took a sample of 8 916 295 tracking requests done over a period of one week -- here's a few fun numbers we found:

- On average, each tracking request is sent 10.5 times to us. Clearly an indication that shipments get there faster if they are tracked a lot!
- Some shipments are tracked a lot of times! The most popular one was tracked 13 791 times, the runner up has 10 041 tracking requests.
- Only 312 231 tracking requests happened only once -- that's only 3.5%.
- 177 856 tracking requests were seen over 10 times that's a bit less than 2%.
