Sometimes it's fun to take a break and look back at what's happened in the past and do a little reflection. Or maybe we just think numbers are fun -- there's probably a reason why we like computers! So today we have sat down and looked at the recent past to try to find some interesting numbers. Everyone knows there's strength in numbers, so here we go!

So let's try to find out what 42 developers can do in 365 days!
---

We have produced a total of 6296 pull requests on github -- that's change proposals to code and documentation.

We seem to write about 2.8 code review comments per pull request and there was one pull request with a whooping 202 comments on it! Most pull requests have much fewer, because we prefer to make small pull requests, so there's usually not that much to discuss.

Also you know what is more amazing than writing a brand new super-useful, super important piece of code? Deleting it! ahh, Joys of Deleting.

One heroic developer deleted 1.24M lines alone. That's probably saving us megabytes of disk space. Megabytes!

We produced 4469 releases of our applications. That's more than 20 releases per working day!

By the looks of it, we're deploying most of the time. The last year, we have logged 26 284 deploys in total!

12 721 to our happy test servers who enjoy life on the bleeding edge,

9 459 times to our more stable QA servers...

... 4 104 to our lovely production servers.

In order to get all of that work done, our deploy script has been running for more than 3 513 887 seconds, or just a little bit less than 6 weeks.

It's a very diligent script!

What do our users do?

This would really take way too much investigation to answer thoroughly, but one thing we know they really like doing is to track shipments!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/webteam-in-numbers/tracking.svg">

We took a sample of these tracking requests done over a period of one week -- here's a few fun numbers we found:

- On average, each tracking request is sent 10.5 times to us. Clearly an indication that shipments get there faster if they are tracked a lot!
- Some shipments are tracked a lot of times! The most popular one was tracked 13 791 times, the runner up has 10 041 tracking requests. Let's just hope that at least some of those requests were done by computer programs, not people!
- Only 312 231 tracking requests happened only once -- that's only 3.5%.
- 177 856 tracking requests were seen over 10 times that's a bit less than 2%.
