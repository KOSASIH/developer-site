        <h2>No applicable services found</h2>
        <p align="justify">When no services are applicable for the requested you've made an empty resultset is returned. Reasons can be that the shipment was too large or too small, or the requested shipment
          was outside the coverage area of the requested services. Your code should handle these cases, i.e. an empty result, and should not fail because of this.</p>
        <p align="justify">How can I fix this? You could e.g. use a Cargo service when you want to send large shipments, or you could request other services and see which ones that fits your need and find your service by using <a href="https://www.bring.no/english/sending">What would you like to send?</a>.

        <h2>Failover when I can't reach the API</h2>
        <p align="justify">Offline data lets you download a failover version of the data from the Shipping Guide.</p>

        <p align="justify">By using the Offline Data Web Service or <a href="/shipping-guide/offline">Offline Data form</a> you can download price lists, transport times and additional services designed for offline usage.
          Offline data is suitable as a failover solution if the Shipping Guide does not respond or responds with an error message, or if there are extreme demands on performance.</p>

        <p align="justify"><strong>Important!</strong> With offline data, you have to deal with all the rules of special goods, shipping calculated weight (volume weight), and more.
          These rules are located on the respective product pages on bring.com. Remember to update the database at price changes!</p>

        <p align="justify">The service is available free of charge, provided acceptance of the terms of use. Note that only registered users will receive notifications of changes in service!</p>

        <p align="justify">For those who use the offline data, we recommend to get the updates automatically via Offline Data Web Service.</p>

        <h2>Holidays and Home Delivery</h2>
        <p align="justify">There is no home delivery on bank holidays. It can also happen that Bring will not do home delivery on certain days during Christmas or Easter. The service will not take this into account.
          This must be handled by clients. End-users should not get delivery dates for holidays.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="api__section">
        <h2>More than one customer number with JSON</h2>
        <p align="justify">This is now possible with version 2.0. Now we can request for multiple products with multiple customer number in single REST request similar to that SOAP version.
          Way this has been made possible is to send product along with API customer number delimited with <i>:</i>. More details can be found <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/#get-shipment-prices-and-estimated-delivery">here</a> </p>

        <h2>Adjusting prices</h2>
        <p align="justify">We do not support price adjustment in Shipping Guide 2.0. The pricing model is very simple now.
          It should be very easy to do price adjustment at client side.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="api__section">
        <h2 class="anchored">Should I handle warnings?</h2>
        <p align="justify">Ideally clients should not parse these warning codes for any logic as they are bound to change. These are supposed to be treated as informational data.
          More info can be found <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/upgrade-to-version-2/#introduced-warnings">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>HTTP status codes in JSON interface</h2>
        <p align="justify">
          The JSON interface uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP status codes</a> to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some codes with added context :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            400 - Bad Request. If request parameters are bad, or any of the mandatory request parameters is missing.
          </li>
          <li>
            401 - Unauthorised request. If user has not sent MyBring authentication header or invaild X-MyBring-API-Uid/X-Mybring-API-Key
          </li>
          <li>
            404 - If the request doesn't come from API domain URL (api.bring.com).
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="api__section">
        <h2>Additional service XXX is not applicable for product YYY</h2>
        <p align="justify">If a requested additional service is not supported on requested product, API will just ignore that additional service for price calculation and return info as a trace message.
          Supported list of addtional services on products can be found <a href="/api/products/#additional-services">here</a>.
