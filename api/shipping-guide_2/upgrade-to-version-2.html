          <h1 class="api__title">Upgrading to version 2</h1>
          <p>This is a short summary of the differences between version 1 and 2 of the Shipping Guide API and will help
            you migrate to version 2 of the API.</p>
          <p>We recommend always updating to the latest version and to do it at your earliest convenience. Upgrading to
            the latest version miximizes the time between upgrades.</p>
          <p>The older 1.x versions will become deprecated and shut down some time in the future.</p>

          <h2>SOAP and JSON interface</h2>
          <h3>What we have changed</h3>
          <p>This section describes the main changes we have done to both the SOAP and the JSON interface</p>
          <h4>Authentication is mandatory</h4>

          <p>
            Authentication is mandatory. If we know you better, we will be in better position to notify you about new features in future and also about changes to API in general.
            It is similar to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/api/index#authentication/">authentication</a> process to what we had earlier.
            What is changed, we do not need to send X-Bring-Client-URL in headers now since you are already authenticated.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are a new user, Signup <a href="https://www.mybring.com/signup/register/user">here</a>.
            After login into Mybring, the API key will be generated by default. You will find your API key  <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/">here</a>

            <br><br>
            <b>Note:</b> If you are already using Mybring authentication, same API key could be reused.

          <p>
            In version 1 of the Shipping Guide API client and server error responses are mainly a HTML document
            describing what went wrong, but in some cases trace messages are used. In version 2 this is changed to be
            easier to parse and to... TODO: finish selling points
            You can read more about the new format of the errors in <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/#handle-api-errors">Handle API errors</a> and
