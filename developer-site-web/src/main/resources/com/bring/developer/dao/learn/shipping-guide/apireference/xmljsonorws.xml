<h2>Recommendation to developers</h2>
<p>Add the name of the webshop to the HTTP header "User-Agent", when you send a request to the service. Preferably also the name of webshop provider if applicable.</p>
<p>If you have a registered user at fraktguide.bring.no, please also include XML API's Public ID parameter in the query.
This makes it possible for us to send any relevant messages via the registered e-mail address.</p>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p>NB! Remember to use timeout and error handling when making requests to the service. Handle errors in a way that is satisfactory for your online store, see <a href="/learn/shipping-guide/introduction/errorcodes.html">Error codes</a>.</p>
<h2>Error Handling Strategies:</h2>
<p>Use the """offline data to calculate price, or</p>
<p>Set a fixed standard price of the package</p>
<p>Note that if a package is out of coverage area or are too big / heavy to send, the Shipping Guide may not offer any products for sending and thus gives an empty answer set. Remember to add a default handling of this case.<p>
