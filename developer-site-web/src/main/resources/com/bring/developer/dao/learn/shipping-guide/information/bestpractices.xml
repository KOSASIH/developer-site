<h2>Recommendation to developers</h2>
<p>Add the name of the web-shop to the HTTP header "User-Agent", when you send a request to the service. If available, the name of the web-shop owner should also be added to the request.</p>
<p>If you have a registered user at fraktguide.bring.no, please also <a href="../documentation/apireference.html#public-id">include XML API's Public ID parameter in the query</a>.
This makes it possible for us to send any relevant messages via the registered e-mail address.</p>
