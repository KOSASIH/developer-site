  The Shipping Guide (Fraktguiden) is a free service from Bring that&mdash;for most shipping alternatives offered by Bring&mdash;provides
  <ul>
    <li>price information,</li>
    <li>service area (norwegian: dekningsomr√•de), and</li>
    <li>estimated delivery times.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  With the Shipping Guide it is easy to offer different shipping alternatives to your end customers. Whether they want to
  <ul>
    <li>get delivery to the door (daytime or evening),</li>
    <li>pick up the shipment at a post office, or</li>
    <li>get the shipment delivered to the mailbox</li>
  </ul>
  The Shipping Guide returns the recommended way to present these shipping alternatives, as well as prices and delivery times.

  The demo shows that the Shipping Guide returns product categories for each request, making a shipping alternatives-page easy to set up.
  The focus is on delivery methods to the end customer, not product names.
</p>
<p>
  The Shipping Guide has several interfaces (SOAP and XML/JSON).
  Choose the option that fits your needs best (see table below).
  The SOAP interface is the core interface with complete functionality.
  There are some limitations in the XML/JSON API, such as the inability to mark a parcel as a specialized goods.
</p>
<p>
  There is also a <a href="/additionalresources/offlinedata.html?from=shipping">Offline SOAP service</a> for retrieving data for offline use (get complete prices, service area and delivery times based on a fixed sender postal code).

            <td>The XML API is an easy way to integrate with the Shipping Guide using plain HTTP clients. It is also the best API to use when exploring the service using a web browser.
            </td>
            <td>Web browsers can (using JavaScript) retrieve information from external sites if the data are made available in JSONP
                format. The purpose is that you can paste HTML / Javascript on your web page and easily use data
                from the Shipping Guide without server components on your web page. See <a href="/widget/displayshippingguideinformationusingjsonp.html?from=shipping">widgets</a>.
            </td>
            <td>The SOAP API has the complete feature set of the Shipping Guide. It requires a SOAP client and the use of our <a href="/additionalresources/wsdl-xml-schema.html?from=shipping">WSDL</a>.
              It has an Online version (one request per shipment) or an offline version (e.g. nightly fetch prices, service area and delivery times based on a fixed consignor postal code).
